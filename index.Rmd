# Executive Summary:

The scope of this study is to develop a random forest algorithm to predict the price of the client’s potential Airbnb listings. Section 1 introduces the business problem and the methods used to address it. Section 2, outlines details of the dataset and any pre-processing necessary, as well as presents the random forest model. Section 3 examines the random forests’ tuning process and presents the model results in comparison to an OLS model. Finally, section 4 discusses the findings, and section 5 concludes, providing directions for future work.
